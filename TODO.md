## üö® CURRENT ARCHITECTURE & PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

### üî∂ CURRENT: Architectural Issues

#### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED: Unbounded Channel Usage** ‚ö†Ô∏è **FIXED**
- **Issue**: `mpsc::unbounded_channel()` in multiple modules could cause memory exhaustion
- **Risk**: Memory leaks under high load
- **Locations Fixed**: 
  - `src/p2p.rs:192` - P2P message channel now bounded (1000 buffer)
  - `src/watcher.rs:143` - Watcher shutdown signal now bounded (1 slot)
  - `src/debounce.rs:169` - Debounce shutdown signal now bounded (1 slot)
- **Solution Applied**:
  - ‚úÖ Replaced P2P message channel with `mpsc::channel(1000)` for message buffering
  - ‚úÖ Replaced shutdown signals with `mpsc::channel(1)` for control signals
  - ‚úÖ Added proper backpressure handling with `try_send()` and error logging
  - ‚úÖ Updated all type signatures and function parameters
  - ‚úÖ All tests passing after changes

#### 2. **Inefficient Chunk Storage** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: HashMap uses hex string keys requiring constant conversions
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with many chunks
- **Location**: `src/storage.rs:29`, `src/storage.rs:78-159`
- **Fix Required**:
  - Use `[u8; 32]` directly as HashMap keys
  - Implement custom hasher for byte arrays
  - Eliminate hex string conversions in hot paths

#### 3. **Circular Dependencies** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**
- **Issue**: P2PService ‚Üî SyncService circular dependency
- **Risk**: Initialization order problems, potential deadlocks
- **Location**: `src/p2p.rs:155-169`, `src/sync.rs:47-61`
- **Fix Required**:
  - Implement dependency injection pattern or service locator
  - Consider event-driven architecture with message passing
  - Break circular references using traits/interfaces

### üîπ Performance & Efficiency Issues

#### 4. **Blocking I/O in Async Context** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: Some `std::fs` operations in async functions
- **Risk**: Thread pool exhaustion, poor performance
- **Location**: Various locations where `std::fs` is used instead of `tokio::fs`
- **Fix Required**:
  - Replace all `std::fs` with `tokio::fs`
  - Wrap necessary blocking operations in `spawn_blocking`
  - Audit all I/O operations for async compliance

#### 5. **Unencrypted Chunk Storage** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: Chunks stored in plaintext on disk
- **Risk**: Data exposure if storage is compromised
- **Location**: `src/storage.rs:103-130`
- **Fix Required**:
  - Implement at-rest encryption for chunks
  - Use authenticated encryption (AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305)
  - Secure key management for encryption keys

### üî∏ Code Quality & Maintainability

#### 6. **Excessive Dead Code Annotations** ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW**
- **Issue**: Many `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations suggest incomplete implementation
- **Risk**: Maintenance burden, unclear API surface
- **Location**: Throughout codebase
- **Fix Required**:
  - Remove unused code or complete implementations
  - Clean up API surface
  - Document intended vs unimplemented features

#### 7. **Inconsistent Error Handling** ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW**
- **Issue**: Mix of `anyhow::Result` and custom error types without clear boundaries
- **Risk**: Poor error propagation and debugging
- **Location**: Various modules
- **Fix Required**:
  - Define clear error hierarchy with domain-specific types
  - Standardize error handling patterns
  - Add proper error context and tracing
