# SlySync CLI - TODO & Development Roadmap

## üöÄ Current Status
The SlySync CLI has successfully evolved from individual components to a cohesive, working file synchronization system with enterprise-grade architecture. The core systems are integrated and functional, but several key features need completion to achieve full P2P file synchronization.

## üî• High Priority - Core Functionality

### File Path Resolution
- [ ] **Fix relative path handling in sync folders** (`sync.rs`)
  - Current: `get_relative_path()` method needs proper path resolution
  - Impact: File operations may fail with incorrect paths
  - Files: `src/sync.rs:341` - `get_relative_path()` method

### P2P Message Handling 
- [ ] **Complete P2P message processing** (`p2p.rs`)
  - Current: Placeholder implementations for all message types
  - Need: Actual chunk request/response handling
  - Files: `src/p2p.rs:446-477` - message handling match arms
  ```rust
  // TODO: Handle chunk request (line 446)
  // TODO: Handle chunk response (line 450) 
  // TODO: Handle file update (line 454)
  // TODO: Handle auth challenge (line 458)
  // TODO: Handle auth response (line 462)
  ```

### Peer-to-Peer Chunk Transfer
- [ ] **Implement actual chunk request/response system**
  - Current: RequestManager exists but not connected to P2P messages
  - Need: Connect `RequestManager` with `P2PService::handle_message()`
  - Files: `src/p2p.rs:254`, `src/requests.rs`

- [ ] **Complete chunk verification and response flow**
  - Current: `send_request()` has placeholder response waiting
  - Need: Actual request/response matching and timeout handling
  - Files: `src/p2p.rs:477` - "Wait for and verify response"

### File Synchronization Logic
- [ ] **Complete peer file update propagation**
  - Current: File deletion not propagated to peers
  - Need: Send deletion notifications to all connected peers
  - Files: `src/sync.rs:206` - "Propagate deletion to peers"

## üõ†Ô∏è Medium Priority - CLI Features

### Status Command Implementation
- [ ] **Implement actual status checking** (`cli.rs:164`)
  - Current: Shows "Up to date" placeholder
  - Need: Check sync status with peers, pending files, conflicts

- [ ] **Implement peer counting** (`cli.rs:165`)
  - Current: Shows "0 connected" placeholder
  - Need: Query P2PService for active peer connections

- [ ] **Implement file counting and size calculation** (`cli.rs:168-169`)
  - Current: Shows "0 files, 0 bytes" placeholder
  - Need: Scan sync folders and calculate totals

### Invitation System
- [ ] **Complete invitation code generation** (`crypto.rs:109-112`)
  - Current: Placeholder values for peer_id, address, signature
  - Need: Generate actual cryptographic invitation codes
  - Impact: `slysync link` and `slysync join` commands won't work

- [ ] **Implement invitation signature verification** (`crypto.rs:135`)
  - Current: "TODO: Verify signature" comment
  - Need: Ed25519 signature verification for security

## üîí Security & Authentication

### Peer Authentication
- [ ] **Implement proper peer identity verification** (`p2p.rs:210`)
  - Current: Placeholder peer authentication
  - Need: Ed25519 public key verification for all peers

- [ ] **Complete auth challenge/response flow** (`p2p.rs:458-462`)
  - Current: Auth messages not processed
  - Need: Cryptographic handshake implementation

### Request Security
- [ ] **Implement proper request/response matching** (`p2p.rs:95, 254`)
  - Current: No request validation or matching
  - Need: Prevent replay attacks and unauthorized requests

## üåê Network & Discovery

### mDNS Discovery
- [ ] **Implement mDNS-based local network discovery** (`p2p.rs:346`)
  - Current: Placeholder implementation
  - Need: Automatic peer discovery on local networks
  - Libraries: Consider `mdns` or `zeroconf` crate

### Connection Management
- [ ] **Improve peer connection lifecycle**
  - Current: Basic connection tracking
  - Need: Automatic reconnection, connection health monitoring
  - Need: Graceful handling of network interruptions

## ‚ö° Performance & Optimization

### Bandwidth Management
- [ ] **Implement bandwidth throttling**
  - Current: No bandwidth limits
  - Need: Configurable upload/download rate limiting
  - Requirements: Must saturate 1 Gbps LAN when unthrottled

### File Change Detection
- [ ] **Optimize file monitoring performance**
  - Current: Basic notify implementation
  - Target: File change detection latency < 100ms
  - Need: Debouncing for rapid file changes

### Resource Usage
- [ ] **Optimize idle CPU usage**
  - Target: Idle CPU usage < 1%
  - Need: Profile and optimize hot paths
  - Need: Efficient file system watching

## üìã Advanced Features

### Conflict Resolution
- [ ] **Implement conflict resolution for simultaneous modifications**
  - Current: No conflict detection
  - Need: Timestamp-based or vector clock conflict resolution
  - Need: User interface for manual conflict resolution

### Selective Synchronization
- [ ] **Add file filtering and ignore patterns**
  - Current: Syncs all files in watched folders
  - Need: `.syncignore` file support
  - Need: Configurable file type filters

### File History
- [ ] **Implement file version history**
  - Current: Only current file versions
  - Need: Keep configurable number of file versions
  - Need: Ability to restore previous versions

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Integration Tests
- [ ] **Create comprehensive integration tests**
  - Need: Two-peer sync scenario tests
  - Need: Network interruption recovery tests
  - Need: Large file synchronization tests

### Performance Tests
