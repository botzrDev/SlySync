# SlySync CLI - TODO & Development Roadmap

## üöÄ Current Status
The SlySync CLI has successfully evolved from individual components to a cohesive, working file synchronization system with enterprise-grade architecture. The core systems are integrated and functional, but several key features need completion to achieve full P2P file synchronization.

## üî• High Priority - Core Functionality

### File Path Resolution
- [x] **Fix relative path handling in sync folders** (`sync.rs`)
  - Current: `get_relative_path()` method needs proper path resolution
  - Impact: File operations may fail with incorrect paths
  - Files: `src/sync.rs:472` - `get_relative_path()` method

### P2P Message Handling 
- [x] **Complete P2P message processing** (`p2p.rs`)
  - Current: Placeholder implementations for all message types
  - Need: Actual chunk request/response handling
  - Files: `src/p2p.rs:407-445` - message handling match arms
  ```rust
  // TODO: Handle chunk request (line 407)
  // TODO: Handle chunk response (line 428) 
  // TODO: Handle file update (line 436)
  // TODO: Handle auth challenge (line 445)
  // TODO: Handle auth response (line 445)
  ```

### Peer-to-Peer Chunk Transfer
- [x] **Implement actual chunk request/response system**
  - Current: RequestManager exists but not connected to P2P messages
  - Need: Connect `RequestManager` with `P2PService::handle_message()`
  - Files: `src/p2p.rs:286`, `src/requests.rs`

- [x] **Complete chunk verification and response flow**
  - Current: `send_request()` has placeholder response waiting
  - Need: Actual request/response matching and timeout handling
  - Files: `src/p2p.rs:428` - "Wait for and verify response"

### File Synchronization Logic
- [x] **Complete peer file update propagation**
  - Current: File deletion not propagated to peers
  - Need: Send deletion notifications to all connected peers
  - Files: `src/sync.rs:243` - "Propagate deletion to peers"

### Invitation System
- [x] **Complete invitation code generation** (`crypto.rs:122-128`)
  - Current: Placeholder values for peer_id, address, signature
  - Need: Generate actual cryptographic invitation codes
  - Impact: `slysync link` and `slysync join` commands won't work properly

- [x] **Implement invitation signature verification** (`crypto.rs:135`)
  - Current: "TODO: Verify signature" comment
  - Need: Ed25519 signature verification for security
