# SlySync Security Audit Report

## Overview
Comprehensive security audit of SlySync v0.1.0 covering:
- Cryptographic foundations (`crypto.rs`)
- Synchronization core (`sync.rs`)
- P2P networking (`p2p.rs`)
- Chunk storage (`storage.rs`)

## Cryptographic Security
### Strengths
- **Ed25519 signatures** for identity and invitations
- **BLAKE3 hashing** for chunk verification
- Secure invitation code handling with cryptographic validation
- Short-lived certificates (7 days) for QUIC connections

### Concerns
- No key rotation mechanism
- Certificate generation lacks revocation support
- Invitation codes don't expire

## Synchronization Core
### Strengths
- Path validation against directory traversal
- Conflict detection with user resolution options
- Debounced file event processing
- Chunk-based synchronization (64KB chunks)

### Concerns
- `resolve_sync_file_path()` uses first sync folder only
- No distributed garbage collection for orphaned chunks
- Conflict resolution blocks user input

## P2P Networking
### Strengths
- QUIC implementation with TLS 1.3
- Certificate pinning and TOFU model
- Bandwidth management integration
- Secure peer authentication
- Invitation-based peer connection

### Critical Issues
1. **Authentication Bypass**  
   `authenticate_peer()` marks peer as authenticated without verifying response  
   [Code Reference](src/p2p.rs:963)

2. **Insecure Defaults**  
   Client config allows any IP connection without validation  
   [Code Reference](src/p2p.rs:787)

3. **Message Handling**  
   No size validation on incoming messages (1MB limit may be insufficient)

## Storage System
### Strengths
- Content-addressable storage with BLAKE3
- Reference counting for garbage collection
- Automatic corruption detection
- Partial file tracking

### Concerns
- No encryption at rest
- Startup verification could be expensive
- File manifests not persisted
- No chunk compression

## Recommendations
### Critical
1. Fix authentication handshake verification
2. Implement proper certificate validation
3. Add message size validation and limits

### High Priority
4. Implement distributed garbage collection
5. Add encryption at rest for stored chunks
6. Make conflict resolution non-blocking

### Medium Priority
7. Add key rotation mechanism
8. Implement invitation expiration
9. Add chunk compression
10. Persist file manifests

### Low Priority
11. Add startup verification progress reporting
12. Implement configurable chunk size
13. Add certificate revocation support

## Conclusion
SlySync demonstrates strong cryptographic foundations and innovative P2P synchronization architecture. Addressing the critical authentication issue and implementing the high-priority recommendations will significantly improve the security posture before public release.
