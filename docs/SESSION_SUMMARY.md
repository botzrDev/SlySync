### Architecture Enhancements
```rust
// Bandwidth Management Integration
pub struct P2PService {
    // ...existing fields...
    pub bandwidth_manager: Option<Arc<bandwidth::BandwidthManager>>,
}

// Upload throttling in chunk responses
if let Some(bw_manager) = &bandwidth_manager {
    if let Err(e) = bw_manager.request_upload_quota(chunk.len() as u64).await {
        warn!("Upload bandwidth limit exceeded, delaying chunk response to {}: {}", peer_id, e);
    }
}

// Download throttling in chunk processing
if let Some(bw_manager) = &bandwidth_manager {
    if let Err(e) = bw_manager.request_download_quota(data.len() as u64).await {
        warn!("Download bandwidth limit exceeded, delaying chunk processing from {}: {}", peer_id, e);
    }
}
```
